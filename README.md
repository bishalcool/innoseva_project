# innoseva_project
- Records.csv contains the dummy data.As this project is developed in php a local server is needed.I have done this using xampp.Bootstrap is used for good user interface.Two php files have been created i.e,index.php and validate.php.

- To run the project copy the folder in the htdocs of xampp folder and run in the browser using "localhost/innoseva_proect".

- Insert the values that have been saved in records.csv
for eg:- Firstname :- ram
		Lastname :- thapa
		Phone:- 1234567890
		Address:- Bhaktapur

- You can test the other records from records.csv
